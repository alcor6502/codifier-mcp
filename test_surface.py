test_surface.py — the static checks, the ones that cover the hole the runtime
tests cannot see.

test_collaudo.py exercises the ENGINE. Nothing there ever imports server.py,
because importing it would drag in FastMCP, a GitHub OAuth provider and a
listening socket. So the seam between the two files — the one place where a
renamed parameter goes unnoticed until a chat calls the tool — is checked here,
by reading the source instead of running it:

  1. every registry.<method>(...) in server.py exists on Registry, and the call
     is compatible with its signature;
  2. every tool that reaches a MUTATING method of the engine goes through
     _admin first. The set of mutating methods is DERIVED from rules.py, not
     typed out here: a list copied into a second file drifts, and this one would
     drift towards "unguarded";
  3. no docstring names a tool that does not exist. The v4.0 docstring of
     rules_list pointed at `rules_projects`, which was never a tool — a broken
     pointer inside the very text that enters every chat's context.

No network, no FastMCP, no Docker: this parses the files.
Run it with `python3 test_surface.py`. Exit code 0 means green.
