# The suites, run the only way their verdict can be trusted: each one into its
# own log, then the EXIT CODE. A suite piped into `tail` shows the last lines
# of stdout, which are PASS lines, while the traceback that killed it went to
# stderr — a suite dead halfway reads green. This repository has already read
# hundreds of greens off a test_surface that died on a missing build.yml.
#
#   scripts/test.sh              build the bench, run every suite, print the verdict
#   PYTHON=python3.12            the interpreter (default: python3.12 — the image's)
#   CODIFIER_WORK=<dir>          reuse a bench instead of building a fresh one
#
# The bench is a venv with the common engine installed FROM THE PIN in
# requirements.txt — the tarball when the network allows it, a git clone of the
# same tag when it does not (the cloud sandbox's egress answers 403 to the
# tarball and still serves git). Either way test_surface compares the pin with
# what got installed, so the two cannot drift. `cryptography` comes in on its
# own because the engine is installed --no-deps, exactly as build.yml does it:
# the suites need no FastMCP, and that is what lets them run in a minute.
#
# The suites run IN ORDER and the script stops at the first red: a later suite
# imports what an earlier one just proved broken, and its verdict would only
# add noise under the one that matters.
#
# Every path is the script's own: never a fixed name under /tmp, which is shared
# and not yours, and where a `cat >` that fails does not stop the line after it.
