# One delivery, end to end, from a machine that has nothing but the clone:
# suites, commit of the NAMED files, push straight to main, proof of the push,
# and — when VERSION moved — the link that publishes the release.
#
#   scripts/ship.sh <message-file> <file>...
#
# The message file is the commit message: one lowercase line saying what
# changes and why, a blank line, then the body. Files are NAMED, never `-A`:
# a working tree can hold another hand's half-written change, and `-A` has
# already shipped one of those with the suite green.
#
# Why there is no tag push: from the sandbox `git push origin v7.1.0` answers
# 403 — branches are pushed, tags are not — and a tag typed on a tablet came
# out as `V7.0.0`, which the workflow's case-sensitive glob ignored in silence.
# So the tag is never typed: the script prints a release URL with the tag, the
# target and the notes already filled in, and one tap on Publish creates the
# tag that starts the same CI. The tag comes out lightweight; the workflow
# reads GITHUB_REF_NAME and does not care.
#
# ⚠ VERSION lives in rules.py, not in server.py as it does in the twin: the
# engine is what the suites import, and the server is what imports the engine.
